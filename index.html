        <p class="quote">
          “I define boldness as confidence and simplicity. Being bold is not necessarily about being loud, but rather about creating more with less.

          “They say too much of it can be dangerous. Confidence. It ignores any negativity and all possibility of failure. It can manifest through hubris but is rooted in absolute security and trust. A mental hack. Your own source code. Affirmation that everything is under control.”

        <p class="quote">
          “To be curious is to engage the world with intense interest. To ask questions, to understand, to grow. It’s the rush I feel when I want to know what happens next, or how the story ends.

          “To feel liberated relates directly to feelings of freedom. You can go anywhere, do or be anything without fear of any social conventions. People who are liberated push boundaries, set new conventions, and challenge the world around us as we know it. Liberation comes with a strong sense of energy, desire, and momentum.”

      Emotions are everything.
    </h1>

    <p>
      We believe every company can perform better if its brand connects with people on an emotional level. A brand that’s emotive triggers feelings, inspires action, earns loyalty, and lifts spirits. In the overcrowded business world, your brand must resonate rationally and emotionally to cut through the noise. Never overlook the mind, but always aim for the heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      These 50 feelings are a selection from 301 emotions we use to help our clients build successful brands. For each entry, we have paired graphic design and animation with quotes from our team and influential thinkers. The result is a visual metaphor that aims to not only illustrate the emotion, but bring it to life. As a whole, we hope this interactive dictionary excites, ignites, and inspires you to view the world in a new way.
    </p>

    <p>

      If you’re looking to spark more emotion with your brand, <a href="larson@emotivebrand.com">get in touch</a>.
