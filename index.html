        <p class="quote">
          I have an internal drive to push myself to the highest potential in a way that also benefits everyone. There’s a huge difference between relaying information and energizing someone for the task ahead. Your emotional tone trickles down. To me, instilling a sense of motivation in others is just as important as finding motivation yourself.

        <p class="quote">
          As important as it is to keep moving forward, I believe there is much to be gained by reflecting on the past. Nostalgia can be a tool for self-reflection &mdash; giving us the insight to learn from our past experiences and grow from them, as we continue to work toward achieving our goals.

          I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. If you are interested in something, no matter what it is. Go at it full speed. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it, and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good.

          Power is not about asserting your dominance over someone else. It’s about having the inner strength to try something new, to do something risky, or to help another person without fear of failure. You have to ask, ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’ and not set too many limitations for yourself.
